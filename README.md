# FloodPreventionSystem
An IoT project for detecting and preventing floods caused by home appliances.

## Setup

Edit FloodPreventionSystem/private_secrets_template.ini with your wifi name and passwod, and rename the file to private_secrets.ini. The project should be easily flashed to any ESP8266 microcontroller using the Platform.io extension in VS Code.

## FoodPreventionSystem (subfolder)

This is a subfolder containing all current source code.

## ELTR2402_FinalDraft.pdf

This is the pdf of my final report for my capstone project at NAIT. It lays out the original design, testing, and implementation for this project. Unfortunately the original source code for this project was lost as it was made before I backed everything up to github. The source code in this repository was re-written after my computer science degree, and because of that, different design choices were made.


## 3D_Objects

A folder containing the 3D models that were 3D printed as a part of this project


## DataSheets

A folder containing the relevant data sheets for the hardware used.
