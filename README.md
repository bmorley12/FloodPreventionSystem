## ELTR2402_FinalDraft.pdf

This is the pdf of my final report for my capstone project at NAIT. It lays out the original design, testing, and implementation for this project. Unfortunately the original source code for this project was lost as it was made before I backed everything up to github. The source code in this repository was re-written after my computer science degree, and because of that, different design choices were made.


## 3D_Objects

A folder containing the 3D models that were 3D printed as a part of this project
